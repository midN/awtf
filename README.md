# AWTF Description
Wrapper for AWS CLI.

Have you ever tried to update existing CloudFormation stack with couple of params?

What if your stack params didn't change and you want to update with existing values ( Nested stacks )?

The result will be an extremely long aws cli command with every Parameter listed out.

That's why i'm writing this right-now-simple Go wrapper for AWS CLI starting with everyday CloudFormation commands i personally use.
